   <title>Install Instructions for YACE</title>

<body>
<p>Steps to deploy <b>Yet Another Crossing Engine, YACE</b></p>
<ol type="I">
<li>Download NiFi from <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/download.html">https://nifi.apache.org/download.html</a>.
	Follow the installation instructions for your platform to finish the installation. This project is developed using
	NiFi 1.1.0 library and it has been verified to works with NiFi versions 1.1.0, 1.1.1 & 1.1.2.</li>

<li>Check out version 0.0.3 of NiFi4Trading from github at
	<a href="https://github.com/aashar/NiFi4Trading/archive/opensource.zip">https://github.com/aashar/NiFi4Trading/archive/opensource.zip</a>.

<li>Copy a) nifi-fix-matching-service-nar-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.nar, b) nifi-fix-matching-simple-service-nar-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.nar, and
    c) nifi-fix-processors-nar-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.nar from NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/compiled
	folder to <NIFI_HOME>/lib directory.</li>

<li>For those we prefer to compile from the source, this project can be built with Maven.</li>

<li>Start NiFi and go to http://localhost:8080/nifi. It could take a while for NiFi to start.
    Please update the URL if NiFi is deployed on a remote server and / or on a different port.</li>

<li>Import YACE template using yace.xml file from NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/NiFiTemplates
	folder using the NiFi template import function</li>

<li>Copy FIX42.xml file from NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/config folder to a local
	directory and configure the ExtractFIXFields processor to use this file as a FIX dictionary. This step is required for receiving
	orders in FIX messaging format.</li>

<li>The following 2 steps are required to receive messages from NiFi and print them on console. There are other options available to support
	this function. I find this utility very useful for general streams processing solution development. Since the scope of this utility is not
	limited to nifi-fix bundle, it is developed as a separate project.

<li>Configure NiFi to support remote raw NiFi port watchers by setting nifi.web.https.host and nifi.web.https.port entries in nifi.properties
	file located in <NiFi_HOME>/conf directory. FYI, I use port 8090 for the NiFi remote raw TCP port. Restart NiFi to apply this change.</li>

<li>Copy nifi-port-to-stdout-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar from NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/compiled folder
	to a local directory. Use portlisteners.bat script in NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/scripts
	folder to start listening on the necessary NiFi ports. These processes do not need to run on the same server where the NiFi instance is running.
	I prefer to use desktop to run these processes and spare the server resources for NiFi.

<li>Copy WebSocketClientforMD.html from NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/scripts folder to a
	local directory and update the URL for NiFi if necessary. This file uses WebSocket to get YACE order book snapshot. This html file
	contains an order entry section for quick order entry using HTTP GET. This order entry action may generate errors due to cross origin
	requests. It is safe to ignore these errors.</li>

<li>sendordercommand.txt file in NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/scripts folder contains the
	REST API to send an order. It uses HTTP GET interface.</li>

<li>Copy GenTestOrders.html from NiFi4Trading-opensource.zip/NiFi4Trading-opensource/nifi-fix-bundle/artifacts/scripts folder to a local
	directory and update the URL for NiFi if necessary. After the rest of the setup is complete open it in a browser. This test script is
	designed to continuously generate orders. It starts with a single order and continues to send new orders for every order-ack it receives.
	Please close this browser tab when sufficient orders are generated in the system.</li>
